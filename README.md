The objective of this project is to create a Movie-Record System on a Linux Operating system and utilize Git and GitHub for version control. By following the instructions below, students will gain hands-on experience in Linux File managegement, Git versioning, and repository setup.
1. Install a Linux operating system of their choice on a virtual machine or on own computer

2. Use your knowledge of Linux file types and hierarchy to create a Movie-record system. A folder that will contain 2 sub-directories (movies & series)

3. The sub-directories would then contain movie-series names eg. moviex,seriesy..

4. Use basic Linux commands and file navigations to create, edit, move, and delete files and directories in your Movie-record system.

5. Create a GitHub repository to store your Movie-record system and version your changes.

6. Use Git to push and pull changes to and from your GitHub repository.
